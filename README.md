RadioFlow

RadioFlow is a full-featured web application designed to organize and manage the workflow of a radio station. It allows different roles—hosts (animateurs/animatrices), technical staff, digital team, production team, administration staff, and admins—to collaborate efficiently and streamline operations.

Key Features:

Role-based access: Admins can assign privileges to each role.

Emission scheduling: Hosts can reserve emission slots with automatic conflict checks and 30-min spacing between emissions.

Episodes management: Each reservation generates a detailed episode with title, description, points, guests, and songs.

Team collaboration: Hosts can add/remove team members, assign tasks, and manage group chats per emission.

Tasks system: Assign, track, and update tasks with deadlines and attachments (images, PDFs, Word files).

Guests & songs library: Centralized database of past guests and suggested songs for future emissions.

Calls log: Record and manage calls with contact info, reasons, and notes.

Calendar views: Daily, weekly, and monthly views of emissions and tasks across the station.

Real-time notifications: Updates for reservations, tasks, and chats.

User profiles: Each user has a profile with photo, bio, contact info, and role-specific permissions.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Laravel (PHP)

Frontend: Blade / Vue.js (optional)

Database: MySQL

Real-time: Laravel Echo + Pusher / Websockets

Goal:
RadioFlow centralizes all the workflows of a radio station, ensures smooth collaboration among teams, and improves efficiency in managing emissions, tasks, and resources.
