## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

RadioFlow

RadioFlow is a full-featured web application designed to organize and manage the workflow of a radio station. It allows different rolesâ€”hosts (animateurs/animatrices), technical staff, digital team, production team, administration staff, and adminsâ€”to collaborate efficiently and streamline operations.

Key Features:

Role-based access: Admins can assign privileges to each role.

Emission scheduling: Hosts can reserve emission slots with automatic conflict checks and 30-min spacing between emissions.

Episodes management: Each reservation generates a detailed episode with title, description, points, guests, and songs.

Team collaboration: Hosts can add/remove team members, assign tasks, and manage group chats per emission.

Tasks system: Assign, track, and update tasks with deadlines and attachments (images, PDFs, Word files).

Guests & songs library: Centralized database of past guests and suggested songs for future emissions.

Calls log: Record and manage calls with contact info, reasons, and notes.

Calendar views: Daily, weekly, and monthly views of emissions and tasks across the station.

Real-time notifications: Updates for reservations, tasks, and chats.

User profiles: Each user has a profile with photo, bio, contact info, and role-specific permissions.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Laravel (PHP)

Frontend: Blade / Vue.js (optional)

Database: MySQL

Real-time: Laravel Echo + Pusher / Websockets

Goal:
RadioFlow centralizes all the workflows of a radio station, ensures smooth collaboration among teams, and improves efficiency in managing emissions, tasks, and resources.
